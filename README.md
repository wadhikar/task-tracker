# Task Tracker

> An easy way to keep track of all the things you need to do!

I like to organize my day by keeping a list of the tasks I need to do. I've used a variety of apps to accomplish this, but I decided to make my own as a way to challenge myself.

## Plan
- ~~Create a frontend UI using React~~
- Create a backend that:
    - Saves tasks in a database
    - Has user functionality (login, own tasks, etc)
